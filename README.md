## Project Overview

The **Robot-Movement-in-Gazebo-Ros2-Humble** project integrates basic robot movements in Gazebo using ROS 2. The key functionalities include:

- **Robot Movement**: Simple control for moving the robot within a simulated environment.
- **Dribbling**: The robot is programmed to simulate dribbling a basketball.
- **Shooting Mechanism**: The robot also demonstrates shooting the basketball towards a goal.
- **ROS 2 Integration**: The project is built using ROS 2 **Humble** for robotic control, ensuring modern middleware and features.

This project is designed for robotics enthusiasts and researchers to test and extend movement control algorithms, sensor integration, and simulation-based validations.

## Installation

### 1. Install ROS 2 Humble

Follow the official instructions to install ROS 2 Humble on your system:  
[ROS 2 Humble Installation Guide](https://docs.ros.org/en/humble/Installation.html)

### 2. Install Gazebo

Gazebo is required to run the robot simulation. Install it using the following command:

bash command:
sudo apt install gazebo11 libgazebo11-dev

### 3. Clone the Repository

bash command:
git clone https://github.com/your-repository/robot-movement-in-gazebo-ros2-humble.git
cd robot-movement-in-gazebo-ros2-humble

The respitory downloaded are required to change the name of the file to "hyphen_robot_description"

### 4. Install Dependencies

bash command:
rosdep install --from-paths src --ignore-src -r -y

---

## Setup and Launch

### 1. Source your ROS 2 environment:

bash command:
source /opt/ros/humble/setup.bash

### 2. Build the workspace:

bash command:
colcon build

### 3. Source the workspace:

bash command:
source install/setup.bash

### 4. Launch the simulation
Launch the robot movement and Gazebo simulation by running:

bash command:
ros2 launch hyphen_robot_description view_robot.launch.py

---

## Movement Control

The robot movement is controlled through ROS 2 topics and services. The robot can move based on:

Twist messages: Control linear and angular velocity for movement in different directions.
You can adjust movement parameters (speed, angle, etc.) in the launch files or through ROS 2 topic commands.


The simulation in Gazebo provides a real-time 3D environment for testing the robot's movements. The robot interacts with the environment, and you can visually observe its performance in tasks such as dribbling and shooting.

## Simulation in Gazebo

The simulation in Gazebo provides a real-time 3D environment for testing the robot's movements. The robot interacts with the environment, and you can visually observe its performance in tasks such as dribbling and shooting.

### Viewing the Simulation
Launch Gazebo via the provided ROS 2 launch file.
Use the Gazebo GUI to visualize the robot's movements and the environment.

---

### Gazebo Plugins and Controllers
The project uses standard Gazebo plugins for simulating the robot's motors, sensors, and physical interactions.

## Dependencies

### ROS 2 Humble

### Gazebo 11

### Python 3

### ROS 2 dependencies: 
For movement, control, and simulation (including geometry_msgs, sensor_msgs, ros2_control).
